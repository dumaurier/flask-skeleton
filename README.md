# Flask Core Application for Workopolis

This is a skeleton for new Workopolis applications. This skeleton includes support for:

* Blueprints
* Sass compilation
* Asset bundling
* Asset versioning
* Translations
* Unit tests

## Running the application

Before you get started you'll need to install the following software in your local environment:

* Node.js
* Gulp

Once you have these installed, open a command prompt at the applications root directory and type "npm install". This will install the Gulp dependencies. Then type "gulp dev-build" to build the application. The application will be available at http://localhost:5000
